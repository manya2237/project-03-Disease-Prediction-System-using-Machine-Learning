# project-03-Disease-Prediction-System-using-Machine-Learning

Dataset was taken from kaggle related to heart disease prediction dataset. </br>Data has been preprocessed and feature selection has been done using lda . 
</br>
Different machine learning models has been trained to predict the label such as decision trees , random forest, svm , logistic regression. </br> Hyperparameter tuning has been done and model has been cross validated.
